				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>There is an adage that says ‘you can never go wrong with the basics’, which is why I often refer back to the basics whenever I code.
				</br>
				Work hard to find the easiest way to get the job done - a mantra I live by.
				</br>	
				My web development journey began in high school with Delphi, on which I got to an intermediate level of programming. I learned more programming languages after high school including Java, C, C++, VHDL, and a bit of HTML and CSS; all of which I am at the beginner level. I recently started Python in which I am rapidly upskilling myself in.
				</br>
				As long as I can find logic in something, it is easy for me to grasp. This gives me an added advantage in problem-solving.
				</br>
				When I come across something interesting and challenging, I will find no rest until I accomplish it. I have found that I can crack anything after taking short break to clear my mind then getting back to it.
				</br>
				I have many great ideas that often can be achieved through programming. I believe that machine learning programming is an interesting programme that can be applied to the ideas that I have. Machine learning is as interesting as it is challenging, which is why I see it as a great opportunity to grow.
