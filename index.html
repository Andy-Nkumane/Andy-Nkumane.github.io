						<h2>Data Wrangling</h2>
						<img src="images/Data-Wrangling.jpg" alt="Data Wrangling">	
						<p>
							Data wrangling is the process of transforming data from one form (raw) into another
							format for easy access and analysis. Also known as cleaning messy and complex (dirty) data.
							Here we have data of accepted recuits containing their respective department and their results
							attained from the tests they took. The project's key concepts were: merging dataframes, 
							filtering dataframes, manipulating rows and columns.

						<h2>Titanic</h2>

						<p>
							Data of all passengers that boarded the Titanic used to determine who would likely survive
							the crash with the iceberg with which features. Features like gender as females were prioritised along with children, ticket class bought depending on the ticket class the passenger got that would roughly determine where the passenger was from the life boats, and other features. Using supervised learning for the machine learning model. Logistic Regression the algorithm used to model.

						<h2>Dice Game</h2>
						<img src="images/dice.jfif" alt="Dice Game">
						<p>
							Dice poker, playing poker with a die. The same rules of poker apply with a little twist, instead of
							cards. Without being limited by the number of the cards, one is able to attain a five of a kind. 
							Imagine being able to change your hand if you do not like what you, even better, to be able to choose which values you want to change - a second chance to getting a better hand. There is a scoring system of which the player gets 100 points when the game starts, each round costs 10 points, game ends when player has less than 10 points. With that said player can quit the game at any point without reaching game over.
